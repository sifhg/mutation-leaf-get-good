# Mutation Leaf Get Good

This is a simulation of a 2D leave growing using a simple neural network on a grid and later getting exposed to damage. The neurons read DNA as well as environmental data to determine the strategy of the leaf's growth. The DNA also determines the neuron's weights and biases.

Different leaves are generated from a mutation algorithm on the DNA. Then the leaves go through a growth process and a damaging process, and the leaf in the best condition after the damage is selected as the parent for the next generation of leaves.
